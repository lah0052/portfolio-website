						<p>My time at West Virginia University not only provided me with an education but also
						facilitated the formation of lifelong friendships and cherished memories. I connected with
						individuals from diverse backgrounds through various avenues such as classes, social events, pickup basketball games, and the gym.
						Within the university community, I participated in philanthropic initiatives, through the Mu Mu
						chapter of Sigma Chi. Our fundraisers raised money for cancer research through the Huntsman Cancer Foundation.
						Our biggest fundraising event called Derby Days raised twelve-thousand dollars my senior year.
						These experiences not only enriched my college years but also reinforced the significance of giving back to the community.

							<p>During my years at SAHS I was commited to academic pursuits while also contributing to the baseball team. Our baseball team was extremely successful,
								clinching the 2017 AAA West Virginia Baseball State Championship and repeating in 2019. These achievements made us the only baseball team in school history to win a state title. High school not only honed my academic and athletic abilities but also sculpted my character, shaping me into the individual I am today.</p>
